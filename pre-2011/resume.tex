\subsection{Relevant Achievements}
\label{exp}

\begin{mylist}
\begin{comment}
\item
Designed, implemented and tested an 8 channel digiitzer system for a wideband phased array. 180 MSPS x 8 channel capture capability provided full bandwidth data (2.9 GB/sec) to a high performance processing PC. Implemented multi-threaded data capture and processing software in C to perform signal detection and geolocation.
\end{comment}
\item 
Created, tested, and deployed Windows-based control software and user interface for a complex tactical RF sensor system, including MySQL data storage back-end, Java operator interface, and multi-threaded real-time data processing module in C.

\item Wrote linux-based data mining tools to extract information from the topology and structure of complex networks.

\item Implemented a C compiler, including parser, AST generation, optimizer, and x86 code emission.

\item
Designed, realized and optimized embedded DSP/control application in an proof-of-concept sensing system. Maximized system availability and maintainability by providing a complete set of system self diagnostics. Optimized system performance to exceed customer requirements, leading to success and expansion of initial contract.

\item
Designed and implemented Windows-based control software and FPGA hardware command interface to directly control functions of concurrently designed RF circuit boards. 
Successfully designed and implemented a custom serial control protocol over USB enable out-of-band troubleshooting, testing and calibration of RF synthesizer and reciever modules.

\item Developed software for a Xilinx microcontroller/FPGA device to communicate simultaneously with 32 aircraft gyroscope modules and interface with a networked desktop computer for testing and calibration purposes.

\item Designed and implemented a high speed analog data acquisition system as a PC104 expansion card, including FPGA programming, PCB layout, and Linux driver programming. 

\item Implemented software for autonomous mobile coordinated robotics system to locate an object within a search area.
